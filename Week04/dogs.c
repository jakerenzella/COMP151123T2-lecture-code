// Recapping 1D arrays! (an array of structs)
// Problem: A dog walking business is keeping track of which dogs are 
// being walked on which day. Each dog is represented as a struct where
// information is stored about the dog's name, age and size. On Monday, 
// we are walking three dogs:
// name: b, age: 4, size: L
// name: a, age: 3, size: XL
// name: c, age: 7, size: M
// Input these into the array and then print out what is happening for the 
// dog walk on Monday. 

// You just got a call, that B is not going to be walking with you tomorrow, 
// and instead you will walk:
// name: d, age: 6, size: M
