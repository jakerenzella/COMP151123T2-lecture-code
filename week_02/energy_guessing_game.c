// A program that lets the user guess how many energy drinks were
// given out at O-Week, and lets the user know if their guess is 
// lower than, higher than or the winning guess!

// Sasha Week 2, Lecture 3

// Problem: We have decided to run a competition to see how 
// many free energy drinks were given out at O-Week.
// Students that guess the right number of drinks given out win!
// You get given three guesses, but you get told whether your 
// guess is less than, greater than or the winning guess!

// Possibilities/Breakpoints?
//

    // How will we solve the problem?
    // How can we break it?

    // Declare and initialise any variables we may use in our solution
